HW1 is an html and css document which is organized to optimize accesibility, while functioning as a working html website that also displays all relavent sections of the media company's composition and its main features as a company. 

The project has been edited to not only maximize accessibility for potentially disabled users, but the code itself has been refactored in order to pare down redundant functions so that a future project manager can initiate new functions without issue. For those also who are less familiar with HTML, the project has also included thorough comments for each section.

The dual index and style sections both function together, and thus anyone without experience should follow the comments to understand which section is which. Running it as well, on the other hand, requires that a user open the file, "HW1," via their default browser.
